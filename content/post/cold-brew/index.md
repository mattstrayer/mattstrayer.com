Today, we're going to go through how to make a perfect batch of cold brew coffee.

### Supplies:

- Coffee beans, 340 grams
- Burr Grinder
- Purified Water
- Gooseneck Kettle (optional)
- Scale
- Coffee Sock
- Gallon Mason Jar


## Bean Prep

The first thing we need to do is prepare the beans. Put a large container on your scale and meausre out 340g of beans. Grind all of these beans coarsely through your burr grinder, for me it was setting 28/40 (40 being the most coarse) on my Baratza Encore.

This is the kind of consistency you want out of the grind.

Put all of those grinds into a container. I used a half-gallon mason jar because it has a perfectly sized opening to dump the beans into the coffee sock later.

## Brew

Make sure the loop is outside of the mason jar and put this big boy in the fridge for 18-19 hours.
